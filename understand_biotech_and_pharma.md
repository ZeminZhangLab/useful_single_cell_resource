### collaboration with pharma
1.  What you need to know when working with big pharma, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2020
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0576-2
    -   clinical trial takes far more than RED (mostly 'discovery')
    -   how pharma think 
        -    **all R&D is targeted on whether a project should be terminated or proceed to the next stage and ultimately market approval. This is an entirely different prospect from blue-sky academic research, where the goal is to open up new lines of investigation**.    
    -   what pharma want   
        -   Indeed, R&D departments regularly create and update lists of ‘wants’: projects that the BD scouts ought to look for when they travel to institutions or attend meetings. Anything that is not in the wants list will not be of interest to the BD executive, **no matter how scientifically exciting**. 
        -   It is not enough to know that a given company is interested in, say, oncology; you must know if they are interested in cancer immunotherapy, oncogenes, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, synthetic lethality, new animal models or something else.
        -   In general terms, pharma companies looking for academic projects will be primarily interested in **new biological targets, new discovery technologies or new animal models**, as opposed to **small molecules, antibodies or new therapeutic modalities**
        -   pharma companies often operate under the assumption that most academic institutions **do not have the right expertise to reliably advance a project through the drug-discovery process toward clinical development**.
        -   A related feature of BD units is that they tend to be more interested in **projects that have already matured in a biotech company than in early-stage academic projects**.
    -   networking with pharma people
        -   best bet to interact with BD people would be to specifically travel to BD meetings, such as the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) International Convention or the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference.
        -   the best people in pharma to know, regarding establishing a collaboration, are the pharma scientists

#   drug discovery (target identification followed by target validation)
1.  What makes a good drug target?, Drug Discovery Today, 2012
    -   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644611004351?via%3Dihub#fig0005
    -   written by Bayer scientists, from a pharma viewpoint
    -   lack of efficiency is major reason of target failure (~50% clinical trial failure)
    -   Properties of an ideal drug target:
        -   Target is disease-modifying and/or has a proven function in the pathophysiology of a disease.
        -   Modulation of the target is less important under physiological conditions or in other diseases.
        -   If the druggability is not obvious (e.g. as for kinases) a 3D-structure for the target protein or a close homolog should be available for a druggability assessment.
        -   Target has a favorable ‘assayability’ enabling high throughput screening.
        -   Target expression is not uniformly distributed throughout the body.
        -   A target/disease-specific biomarker exists to monitor therapeutic efficacy.
        -   Favorable prediction of potential side effects according to phenotype data (e.g. in k.o. mice or genetic mutation databases).
        -   Target has a favorable IP situation (no competitors on target, freedom to operate).
    -    In 2006, a consensus number of 324 drug targets had been proposed for all classes of approved therapeutic drugs [7]. Using bioinfor- matics approaches, Bakheet and Doig identified 668 proteins in the non-target set of 3573 molecules that have target-like proper- ties 
    -   **target evaluation process at Bayer**
    <br><br> ![alt text](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1359644611004351-gr1.jpg)  <br><br>
    -   target identification
        -   One valuable source of novel targets is **relevant literature** because thousands of scientists all over the world are working to unravel novel molecular pathways and the function of genes and proteins. Beside literature, the first hints for target properties come from descriptive studies on **RNA and/or protein expression in target tissues or from a comparison of disease versus healthy tissue**. When combined with pathway analyses and powerful data inte- gration, expression data can provide information on potential targets beyond those regulated by RNA or protein levels.
        -   At Bayer HealthCare, we integrate publicly and internally available infor- mation on targets in the **Phylosopher database** (GeneData, Basel, Switzerland) and make this database available to all scientists at Bayer HealthCare. The targets are then prioritized based on com- plementary evidence from the integrated set of data. However, **when relying on published data**, key results should be replicated internally because a generally low rate of reproducibility, about 30%, of published in vitro and in vivo studies has been experienced in-house 
        -   We believe that the identification of a promising drug target results from a **deep pathophysiological understanding and its causative molecu- lar mechanisms** and the application of relevant target identifica- tion and target validation **technologies**
        <br><br> ![alt text](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1359644611004351-gr2.jpg)  <br><br>
        -   example
            -   Translating these considerations into real drug discovery terms, the interleukin (IL)-2-inducible tyrosine kinase (Itk) could be an innovative concept for the therapy of inflammatory skin diseases [32]. Itk is expressed selectively in diseased tissues. It is present mainly in T cells and is increased in lesional skin from patients with dermatitis. RNA silencing was applied as a target-validation strategy and was followed by in vivo studies (i.e. in an Itk knockout mouse model). Moreover, a SMOL inhibitor was identified that confirmed the role of this kinase in disease models.
        
    
2.  a comment on having a target for drug
    -   "In principle, there is no regulatory requirement to know the molecular target of a drug or clinical candidate since all that matters in the end is that a drug is safe and efficacious. In fact, there are a number of approved drugs for which the mechanism-of-action is unknown. However, the drug development process is obviously greatly facilitated if the target is known since this enables rational design of new molecules with improved potency and safety profiles." Dr. Kilian V. M. Huber, Structural Genomics Consortium & Target Discovery Institute, University of Oxford. 

3.  Believe it or not: how much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets?, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2011
    -   target information from publications has reproducibility issues directly associated with attrition risk of pharma.
    -   target validation is an important task

4. pharma is increasingly selective on targets that enter into the pipeline to ensure success
    -   Trends in clinical success rates and therapeutic focus, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2019
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-019-00074-z
    -   A popular model espoused in the early 2000s to counter attrition — the ‘shots on goal’ approach — was to push a greater number of projects into the pipeline. Data suggest that companies are now more selective about projects taken into early development, with a sharp decline in early-stage project numbers over the decade (Fig. 1b).

5.  Impact of a five-dimensional framework on R&D productivity at AstraZeneca, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2018
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.244
    -   AstraZeneca's 5R principle: (the right target, right tissue, right safety, right patient and right commercial potential)
    -   AstraZeneca scientists now work in fewer disease areas, with a focus on a deeper scientific understanding of disease biology and mechanisms.
The company has also made substantial investments in its capabilities for target selection and validation, lead generation, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling, patient stratification and biomarkers.
    -   right target
        -   An increased focus on a stronger target rationale has led to a marked reduction in the number of projects in the discovery portfolio.
        -   two super-weapon in target validation
            -   **crspr screening**
                -   Recent work with MTH1 (also known as NUDT1), a high-profile and well-studied oncology target, illustrates the impact of genome  editing ref-22. In these studies, cancer cells remained viable after complete silencing of MTH1, suggesting that previously published MTH1 inhibitors were killing cells through mechanisms other than MTH1 inhibition. These data led to a rapid decision to close an MTH1 inhibitor project and have since been confirmed by other groups23 
                -   These examples highlight how genome editing can be used to build confidence in or invalidate a target much earlier than was previously possible.
            -   **using genetic data for validation**
                -   this sounds like what ABio could do, or even worth start up a new company like 23&me ! 
                -   Several companies, including ourselves7 and GlaxoSmithKline25, have noted that selecting genetically validated drug targets can increase success rates in clinical development. For example, exon sequencing of 60,000 patients by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, in collaboration with Geisinger Health System (an integrated health provider in the United States), highlighted the potential role of angiopoietin-related protein 3 (ANGPTL3) inactivation in protecting against cardiovascular disease. for details see ref-26
                -   for a focused review, see:
                    -   The support of human genetic evidence for approved drug indications, Nature genetics, 2015
                    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3314
        -   right lead
            -   screening technologies on small molecules and new modalities are a focus for prosecutingly-challenging but validated targets
        -   **Target validation is now the predominant reason for project closure in early-stage discovery, rising from 15% to 77% (FIG. 3c). This is a consequence of the increased focus on generating evidence that builds confidence in or invalidates the scientific hypothesis.** 
        <br><br> ![alt text](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrd.2017.244/MediaObjects/41573_2018_Article_BFnrd2017244_Fig3_HTML.jpg?as=webp)  <br><br>
        -   **Selecting the right target remains the most important of the 5Rs and the most important investment decision we make in drug discovery.**   
    -   right safety
        -   early assesment of toxicity (essentiality of a gene) might be earlier performed in human-derived models - CRO can do?
        -   we now consider target-related safety liabilities through exploration of the physiological role of the target in healthy and disease settings, leading to early hypothesis testing for target-related safety risks   
        -   Novel models using human-derived systems, such as 3D liver microtissues78 or human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes79, can be integrated early into projects to reduce hepatic or cardiac toxicity risk, two leading causes of clinical failure due to safety reasons80. **This resulted in no safety-related project closures in early discovery in the 2012–2016 cohort,** compared with 6% of project closures from the 2005–2010 cohort (FIG. 3c).
    -   right patient
        -   in a word, companion diagnostic can be included in phase II trials in addition to the clinic.
    -   right commercial potential
        -   At this stage, programmes will be many years from launch, and so commercial valuations are going to be educated guesses at best and completely wrong at worst. For this reason, the ‘right commercial’ profile does not dominate governance or decision-making early in the clinical life of a programme. However, by the time a project reaches the phase III investment decision, a team will need to have a thorough commercial assessment articulated, with clarity around the size of the patient population, the unmet medical need, the required differentiation versus the standard of care, the payer criteria required for global reimbursement, the competitive environment and the likely commercial sale projections   
    -   **investment decisions are commonly made in situations in which there is a high degree of scientific uncertainty within a competitive environment** this might be where we come into play
    -   We must continue to increase the probability of success. This is ever
    -   more important in an environment where pressures related to return on investment, health-care costs and drug prices continue to increase.

6.  How were new medicines discovered?,     Nature reviews drug discovery, 2011
    -   I think the contribution of the article is to drive us re-think whether we're relying too much on target MMOA & lacks phenotypic support. The idea is not which one is the 'right' approach, but lacking either one may have high attrition rates.
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3480
    -   The authors also suggested that target selection may be one of the most important determinants of attrition and overall R&D productivity2.
    -   it has therefore been suggested that the more limited use of phenotypic screening in recent years has contributed to the current lack of suc- cess in drug R&D6,7.
    -   a list of all the drugs and their classification is provided in Supplementary information S1 (table) and **a brief description of the discovery history of first-in-class drugs is provided in Supplementary information S2 (box).** 
        -   https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrd3480/MediaObjects/41573_2011_BFnrd3480_MOESM3_ESM.pdf
    -   An additional approach was to use phenotypic screening to identify new MMOAs for established targets, which led to the discovery of the partial agonists aripiprazole and varenicline, and the full antagonist fulvestrant (see
        -   this really led us to think whether so many IO targets can be corroborated using clinical data - in that phenotypic data is included arter the target is discovered - in its validation phase
    -   disease areas vary in best-practices 
        -   Evaluation of the discovery strategy by disease area showed that a pheno- typic approach was the most successful for central nerv- ous system disorders and infectious diseases, whereas target-based approaches were most successful in can- cer, infectious diseases and metabolic diseases (TABLE 2). Biologics accounted for most of the new medicines that act by modulating the immune system and 50% of the new medicines for cancer.
    -   Our analysis leads us to conclude that **the identification of an optimal MMOA has been a key factor contributing to the success of phenotypic screening in the discovery of the first-in- class NMEs in the 10-year period we studied. Thus, we consider that technical risk and, consequently, overall attrition in drug development could be decreased for first-in-class drugs through the development and greater use of translational phenotypic assays, and by considering diverse MMOAs when using a target-based, hypothesis- driven strategy.**

    -   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644620303354
    -   ideas of this article is mostly covered by others already
    -   Although NGS-based international projects ICGC & TCGA have con- siderably increased the number of actionable cancer mutations [1], the functional impact of mutations on drug targets is largely unknown.
    -   The importance of precise targets cannot be overemphasized be- cause clinically irrelevant targets are the main
cause of failure resulting from a lack of efficacy in Phase II clinical trials [5]

    -   focus more on how to transfer risk of target failure from pharma to academia, smart guys.
    -   Analysis revealed translation into clinical utility as a major hurdle of novel drug target validation, originating from lack of biological understanding, irreproducibility of published results, and lack of valid animal models. 
    -   the pursuit of insufficiently validated drug targets is one of the main reasons for high attrition rates observed in clinical trials. Failures of drugs due to insufficient efficacy are responsible for 51% of clinical phase II and 66% of clinical phase III failures.10,11
    -   The level of confidence required for novel drug targets was mentioned to be different for specific indication areas; for example, in vitro and early in vivo data might be sufficient in oncology but those data are insufficient to initiate a human trial in cardiology.
    -   True confidence in a novel drug target unequivocally comes from proof of clinical concept, when a target-specific
compound shows desired/beneficial therapeutic effect in a clin- ical trial
    -   regarding animal models: The recommendation was to systematically take observations from clinical trials and ‘‘back-validate’’ the respective animal and human in vitro and ex vivo models to reflect clinical observa- tions.

## examples
1.  crispr identifies genes in PD1 resistance
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc.2017.75, Nature reviews drug discovery, commentary, 2017
    -   To identify genes potentially involved in evading the tumour response, the authors used CRISPR– Cas9 to systematically knock out 2,368 genes expressed by B16 melanoma cells
    -   Among genes already known to be involved in immune evasion, such as PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and CD47, the authors identified 50 other genes whose deletion conferred sensitivity to PD1 inhibition. They selected four of these genes — Ptpn2, a phosphatase involved in signalling processes; H2‐T23, which encodes QA1B (HLA-E in humans), a protein that binds the inhibitory receptor NKG2A on T cells and natural killer cells; Ripk1, a kinase that regulates cell death and inflammation; and Stub1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response — based on their highest cumulative score for further validation. 
    -   This study not only offers an obvi- ous target in PTPN2 — even though the development of phosphatase inhibitors is notoriously challeng- ing — but also offers a platform for identifying many more target genes that might mediate sensitivity and resistance to checkpoint inhibition.

2.  treatment-naive single-cell data for drug discovery, commentary, cancer discoery, 2017
    -   https://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/7/7/658.2
    -   **looking at stable expression to select better targets** PD-1 was broadly expressed, but the levels of other inhibitory receptors, such as TIM3 and CTLA4, fluctuated far more, with varying combinations observed both within and among patients. 
    -   **identify new targets via 'highly expressed'** As well, they pinpointed CD38 as a new marker of T-cell exhaustion in ccRCC. “It’s potentially another check- point that could be blocked to relieve immunosuppression,” he says. **is it that all surface protein can be targets given it's at least relevant in immunization & highly expressed? We have so many such things, should know which is the right one** 
    -   **rely on metadata to see disease development stage, more of mechanism study** They reported a strong signature of immunosuppression early on in this disease: Stage I lesions lacked natural killer cells but were rich in regulatory T cells expressing CTLA4, ICOS, and other inhibitory receptors, as well as exhausted PD-1–expressing CD8+ T cells.
    -   **cell types correlate with survival, just some survival analysis** CD103+ dendritic cells—is necessary for enhanced responses to PD-L1 blockade (Immu- nity 2016;44:924–38). I

    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00014-2
    -   new modalities, like immunooncology antibodies, gene/cell-based therapies are large pharma's interest for future, as she said, 'they're only on PD1' so that they want to be early on the next thing.
    -   clinical data (EHR) can make value, as evidenced their collaboration with flatiron & foundation medicide
        -   We have devoted a large amount of resources and time to curating a substantial internal database consisting of our clinical trial data, pathology data, imaging data, ‘omics data and selected external data. 
    -   not much inspiring content though : (
    -   co-founded EQRx
        -   https://www.eqrx.com/perspective/at-the-precipice-of-change/
        -   While many support using aggressive new government regulations to quash drug prices, we started EQRx to create a different, more sustainable path forward: to use free market competition to bring down drug prices and make world-class medicines available and affordable to people who need them. We describe our approach as “fast follow” medicine because our therapies emulate the biological function of existing drugs but have unique enough molecular structures to garner their own patent protections. This concept is not new — companies have been doing this for years, with Lipitor and Humira as examples — but no company until now has used it as a means of competing on price.

4.  Stanley Crooke, left head of R&D at GlaxoSmith and founded Ionis on anti-sense therapy modality
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-019-00157-x
    -   First, the central failure of the industry, I think, was a lack of investment in disruptive new technologies. Quantum changes in productivity in any industry always come from new technologies. Second, I felt that the fully integrated pharmaceutical model — in which firms take on discovery, development and marketing — was highly detrimental to long-term innovation.
    -   1989 was one of those moments in history when lots of big biotechnology ideas were being proposed and funded by venture capitalists. And I was frequently being offered opportunities to run new biotech companies. As I looked at all these ideas, I felt that antisense had the potential to be very **broadly** used in multiple disease categories. And that it, alone, had the potential to actually effect an absolutely fundamental shift in the productivity of drug discovery and development as well.
    -   One of the hardest things to deal with, for me, was actually the emotion around our technology. Scepticism and cynicism, of course, I expected.

5.  Daphne Koller, founded the biotech insitro in 2018 to explicitly generate high-quality biological data sets at high throughput to enable the application of machine learning to drug discovery.
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-019-00115-7
    -   her vision for machine learning in drug discovery, the need to view data as a core asset of a business rather than a byproduct and how to foster computational excellence in biopharma
    -   Q: How are you addressing this need for more high-quality data?
        -   First, we can create cellular models using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
        -   Second, we can perturb individual genes not using short interfering RNA, which has off-target effects that are often much larger than the on-target effects, but rather using CRISPR. 
        -   Third, we have access to improved biological assays. 
    -   Q:  Other groups are also using iPSCs, gene editing and high-content phenotypic assays in drug discovery. What do you do differently to maximize machine learning opportunities?
        -   Well, in part it comes back to scale. But it’s also about very, very thoughtful experimental design.
        -   I was asking a large biologics manufacturer about their biggest pain points, and they said, “Well, we put an antibody sequence into CHO cells and half the time the CHO cells choke and don’t like the antibody and don’t express it. So then we bring in a biochemist, and they look at the sequence and tinker with it. And then we try it again. All this takes months, can cost more than a million dollars and works only a bit more than half the time.”  But for them, the data they would use to do that were a throwaway byproduct rather than a core asset. They were stored in random spreadsheets on different laptops, and would need to be collected, amalgamated and cleaned up. Now, if we wanted to do this we would ask Twist Bioscience to synthesize 100,000 antibody sequences for us — and they do not have to be therapeutically relevant, because we’re never going to put them in humans — and then we would put these into CHO cells and measure expression levels.
        -   **I really doubt her words, to me capable of handling many modalities (sequencing, antibody, etc) require huge investment. To me a moure sound business plan seem to have a specific focus - i.e. if antibody production is a 'broad-enough' issue in the pharma community, then you focus technology investment on antibody only, rather than investing in huge amount of facilities**

6.  Sean Harper, CSO Amgen
    -   www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.262
    -   Amgen bought deCODE genetics for US$415 million in December 2012, with a plan to ramp up their use of human genetic data in drug discovery and development. A treasure trove of genetic data from more than 160,000 Icelanders now informs everything from target selection to clinical trial design. 
    -   We believed at the time of the acquisition that this was the most meaningful step that we could take to address the underlying
issue in our industry, which is poor R&D productivity. A lot of this problem is driven simply by the **high failure rate**, and when you look at the literature you can see a **twofold increase in the overall probability of success when you work with targets that have been validated in humans**.
    -   We’ve now reached a point where roughly 50% of our programmes have what we would consider to be very strong genetic validation for the target. And when you do the calculations, just having strong genetic support for half of your pipeline can improve your rate of return on R&D investments by approximately 50%.
    -   Let me start by talking about **avoiding failures**, because that is a big part of this approach. Within about 4 weeks of acquiring deCODE, they had provided us with **comprehensive assessments of every target we were working on**. And **with that information we terminated about 5% of our pipeline**.
    -   Next, we have many programmes that we have prioritized intensively because deCODE validated the human genetics. 
    -   And then there are completely de novo drug targets that we only discovered because of deCODE’s data. Our anti-ASGR1 antibody for cardiovascular disease is the furthest along of these. (details see article.)
    -   **is it true that such genomic sequences (the style of GWAS) is more useful in cardiovascular diseases and others, rather than in Cancer? To me Oncology seems to fit into different paradigms**

    -   Bristol-Myers Squibb has one of the deepest immuno-oncology drug pipelines, with checkpoint inhibitors, T cell and natural killer cell agonists, and metabolic modulators of the tumour microenvironment. 
    -   We have more than 70 programmes that we are working on, and around 45 potential agents in development right now. My first priority is emphasizing the concept of value and the focus on transformative medicines.
    -   Given that we’ve got so many assets, my second priority is determining how to do rational drug development at this point in time. We know we can’t combine every one of these drugs with each other. How do we use innovative trial design models, analytics and data to help us come up with optimal treatments and combinations?
    -   You’ve advocated for better genomics and diagnostic technologies in cancer drug development, and BMS recently signed deals with liquid biopsy start-up Grail and the genomics firm Foundation Medicine. Do you see these deals as primarily about development and trial-design decisions? 
    -   The biggest hurdle here is the reality that those trials take longer to run. Pharmaceutical companies need to get drugs to patients as quickly as they can, and so often choose advanced disease as the place to demonstrate activity.

    -   Yong-Jun Liu is a drug discovery veteran with a career that has spanned both academia and industry. Since 2002 he has overseen drug discovery programmes at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor Research Institute and AstraZeneca’s biologics company MedImmune. He added another large pharma firm to this roster in 2016, when he joined Sanofi as head of research. Sanofi’s president of global R&D Elias Zerhouni prioritized the development-stage pipeline during the first years of his tenure at the company, but brought Liu on board last year to refocus on the internal early-stage drug discovery efforts. Liu spoke with Asher Mullard about his first year at Sanofi and the company’s emphasis on multi-targeted therapeutics.
    -   I joined Sanofi at a time when the company was transitioning from ‘R&D 1.0’ to ‘R&D 2.0’. It has been 6 years since Elias Zerhouni joined Sanofi as the president of R&D. His strategy initially focused on development, to fill the pipeline with candidates that could be launched within a 5-year time frame. And he has been very successful in this. With R&D 2.0, one of the major goals is to refocus on internal research, moving molecules from the bench into first-in-human trials. 
    -   We have more than 2,000 scientists in our research organization, and I want to reinvigorate this organization as a powerhouse for innovation. That means we are going to generate a lot of targets and a lot of projects internally.
    -   If you want to bring in the seeds of transformative medicines, you need to have good judgement and talented scientists who know where to look and you need a good network of contacts in the scientific community. Our in-house scientists have also done beautiful work into the mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD1 therapy, and have found something very exciting. I cannot disclose what it is yet, but we have a molecule that will be in the clinic by the end of this year targeting a PD1-resistance mechanism.
    -   Will you get more resources to boost your internal capabilities?
    -   No. The headcount is flat and the budget is flat. Our aim is to increase the productivity 2- to 3-fold in 5 years. My focus is on the science and operational efficiency.  To achieve this, I’ve been busy doing deep dives of the company’s portfolio. We have gone through each therapeutic area and each technology platform, bringing all the smart scientists from a therapeutic area or technology platform together and reviewing all of their current projects. The first step is focus. To give you an example, some of the therapeutic areas had 30 projects. At the end of a deep dive, maybe only 5 projects are selected as top priorities. But we will double or triple the resources for these projects, to accelerate the path to the clinic. Then we look at the big, blue-sky science in this area and identify new projects that could become breakthrough drugs. In some areas we have added up to 10 new projects. And then the third thing that we do is build a project team and an implementation strategy.

    -   I would also say that any time a deal comes along that’s a little bit different, that’s intrinsically interesting. As risk capitalists, we have to try to anticipate trends. But of course we really don’t know the future. And if everybody is getting out of antimicrobials, maybe it’s a good time to be in it. Or if everybody is getting out of psychiatry, maybe it’s a good time to be in it. Of course this is hard; we don’t see an abundance of compelling psychiatry assets, for example. But if you are paying attention, and trying to anticipate the market, you also have to pay more attention to assets that are a little bit outside the box.

10. Eric Rubin
    -   You are doing this largely by testing different drug combinations. In a recent paper in Clinical Cancer Research you highlighted the need for **a more rational approach to the exploration of these combinations**. Is this a situation in which a precompetitive collaboration is needed?
    -   I guess a cautionary note I have on this is that we don’t really understand all that well the immune tumour microenvironment. __And so we do need to test combinations empirically__. Our combination of pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy in lung cancer provided quite a prominent effect size, and
I’m not sure people would have predicted that would work out. __You can explain the biology, but you have to do that retrospectively.__ __We track and stack rank our combination data as it comes in, and I can tell you that some of the combinations at the top of the list right now are not the ones that you would predict.__

#   Chinese market
1.  An audience with Samantha Du
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.208
    -   When Samantha Du left Pfizer in 2001 to take up a drug development job in China, the country’s biopharma ecosystem hadn’t contributed much to the global drug pipeline since the 1967 discovery of artemisinin. Now, China’s burgeoning life sciences sector is basking in venture capital, industry and government interest. Earlier this year, the China Drug Administration (CDA) granted a landmark approval for Chi-Med’s fruquintinib, a discovered- and developed-in-China VEGFR inhibitor that Du helped usher towards patients during her time as CSO of Chi-Med. Zai Lab, the company that Du founded in 2014 and that she heads as CEO, is meanwhile setting new precedents by recruiting Chinese patients into global registrational trials. Du spoke with Asher Mullard about the changing Chinese biopharma ecosystem.
    -   We achieved many firsts in China. We were the first Chinese group to set up a collaboration with a global multinational firm to do joint discovery, with Eli Lilly. And we were the first to out-license a programme to a global multinational company, in a deal with AstraZeneca. And Chi-Med’s c-Met inhibitor savolitinib, which the company is developing in partnership with AstraZeneca, is likely to be approved soon in the US, which would make it the first selective c-Met inhibitor to be approved by the FDA.
    -   Q: Your drug development strategy at Zai Lab has been very different, with much more emphasis on in-licensing products that have been discovered elsewhere. Why this change in strategy?
    -   Zai Lab did start out with an in-licensing model. And that’s partly because in 2014 China was very different than it was in 2001. It had become the second largest global pharmaceutical market. But, I had also received a lot of recognition for my work in China, and had been given a lot of credit for leading the way for Chinese biotechs. And that gave me the ability to pick the partners I wanted to work with. So our first focus was on in-licensing. **Around 70% of innovative drugs have not yet been brought to China, even though they’ve been approved elsewhere. So we started with thinking about picking this low-hanging fruit, by in-licensing post-approval projects or compounds that have made it past phase III.**
    -   Chinese biopharma is still at a very young age of innovation. Most of the programmes I have seen in China are still me-better, me-too or me-not-worse programmes. Me-first products are still pretty rare. I think fundamentally, you have to have good biology to get at me-first candidates. move. We need more outstanding academic researchers and more collaborations between Chinese academics and pharma, in order to get more me-first candidates.
    -   Q: Your company recently announced that it recruited the first patient into a phase III trial of the FGFR2b antibody bemarituzumab, and that this is the first time a first patient for a global registrational trial has come from China. Why is this now possible and why is this shift significant?
    -   And because **gastric cancer is much more prevalent in China than it is in the US**, we were able to use our strong local expertise to recruit the first patients for this global programme. **A benefit of this is that because our patient population is so large, recruitment can go faster. And this is very important for drug developers, who want to preserve the patent lives of their products.**
