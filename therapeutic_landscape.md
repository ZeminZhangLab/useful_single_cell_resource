1.  Trends in the global immuno-oncology landscape
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.167#Sec4
    -   (September 2017 to September 2018), there was a 67% increase in the number of active agents in the global IO pipeline (2,031 versus 3,394; FIG. 1).

2.  The immuno-oncology race: myths and emerging realities, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2017
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2016.279
    -   Myth 1. Immuno-oncology approaches alone will cure cancer.
    -   Reality. **Although initial results are promising, not all tumour types have responded to checkpoint inhibitors — and even within ‘immunogenic’ tumour types, 40–60% of nonresponders remain underserved**.
    -   A new race towards first-in-combo and best-in-combo. 
        -   We expect **combination therapies to become the future battleground**, given the impressive early results. 
        -   However, with strong competition for patients, **broad combination programmes** will demand **strong scientific underpinnings**, **well-defined patient sub-segments** and innovative adaptive trial designs.  
    -   Focus on biomarkers and narrower patient populations. 
        -   With a fraction of PDL1-negative patients responding to PD1 or PDL1 inhibitors, the utility of related biomarkers and companion diagnostics remains open to debate for the entire class. 
        -   We expect that **immunoprofiling of tumours before and after treatment will define new patient segments** and determine whether checkpoint inhibitors will serve as potential combination backbones or stepping stones to the next generation of therapies.

5.  FDA expert comments on PD1 drug:
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-019-00105-9
    -   At the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Atlanta earlier this year, the director of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence Richard Pazdur called out drug developers for chasing the crowd with PD1/PDL1 blockers, to the detriment of the clinical trial system and the rest of the cancer pipeline. “Do we just have too many of these same drugs here?”, he asked in the session ‘PD-1 Pandemonium’. https://webcast.aacr.org/s/2019annual/SYPOL08
    -   Q1: are all these PD1 drugs similar?
        -   might be different, PDL1 takes higher dosage than PD1 probably due to wider expression of target.
            -   Israel Lowy Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, United States
            -   PDL1 can be induced by INFG, making it harder to target,
            -   a lot of the difference can be due to more on patient selection
        -   there's a big thing here about improving patient selection
            -   Kevin Chin EMD Serono, Billerica, MA, United States
            -   
    -   Q2: is it there're too many drugs here
        -   renal cell cancer is very wasteful in developing drugs considering the trials.
        -   it isn't we are having too many PD1 trials, we're pushing PD1 more in the fashion like three generations of TKI.
        -   We;re having PD1 not for competing with other companies but to serve as the basis of future combinatory therapies of the immuno-oncology era.
    -   Q3: biomarker & patient stratification, which I believe is key, FDA immuno-oncology head
        -   the clinical development of the drug actually outpaces the biomarker development
        -   biomarker development can be a pre-competitive space for major pharma. this could have IP issue for ABio.
        -   BMS guy: PDL1 is not the end of biomarker, we're looking at TMB, gene expression & a variety of biomarkers.
        -   biomarker field complexity: marker is very dynamic, change with stages of disease, changes with treatment. This biomarker can be translated into companion diagnostics.
        -   biomarker in immuno-oncology is quite different from traditional oncology marker development, probably there's sth we don't know yet.
    -   Q4: I wish I had
        -   Kevin Chin, EMD Serono, Billerica, MA, United States 1:31:00
        -   I wish I had more time, the challenge is we are trying to race through development which is the reason we also fail through phaseIII.
        -   our drug suffers setback in our ovarian cancer, but that being said we knew at the onset it is a risky cell type to go into and immunotherapy hasn't demonstrated a lot of success. It is thought to be a cold tumour and we're learning about a lot of information on the tumour is 'inflammed, cold or desert', if we had that information ahead of time, maybe in phase I & phase II maybe we had procedded a little bit slowly to identify subsets of ovarian cancer patient because maybe immunotherapy still has a role there.

            -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2016.111
            -   the ubiquity of the CD47 marker on healthy blood cells means that on-target toxicity can be a challenge
            -   Surface Oncology and Celgene shuttered phase I CD47 programmes in 2018, citing the competitive landscape
            -   For those who have chosen CD47 on cancer cells, a key potential differentiator is the extent to which they choose to embrace antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity via the Fc region of their biologic candidates. It boils down to whether you want strong cell-killing functionality built into your molecule with an IgG1 tail, weak function with an IgG4, or entirely exogenous cell killing with a combination agent explains Trillium Therapeutics Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) Bob Uger.
        -   47's current strategy
            -   Forty Seven chose the IgG4 approach, which company founder and head of clinical development Mark Chao describes as the just-right ‘Goldilocks’ strategy. It avoids indiscriminate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity responses from NK cells — minimizing dose-dependent and on-target toxicity — while maintaining a discriminating macrophage response, he says. (Just-right doesn’t guarantee success; Surface Oncology and Celgene used IgG4 on their discontinued programmes.)
        -   see original article for competitor's strategies
    -   SIPRa is tested by Gilead, BI, BMS for better specifiticy
    -   CSF1R was scrapped and BMS has acquired and scrapped CSF1R mAb but CSF1R inhibitors got approval on certain cases
    -   new advances  
        -   "Technological advances — including single-cell sequencing — are also opening researchers’ eyes to “a myriad of different macrophage subsets with complex biology that arise from different microenvironments,” 
        -   A recent report in Nature from Weissman’s lab at Stanford suggests that CD24 is a possibly complementary don’t-eat-me cousin of CD47 on certain tumours
        -   "The next big challenge is to under- stand the roles and functions of these subsets, he says, and how deleterious macrophages can be manipulated while sparing others"
        -   "“I think we have to relearn the biology of macrophages in tumours,” says Poirier."

#   targeting signaling pathways  
1.  JAK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for immune and inflammatory diseases, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2017
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.201
    -   JAK/STAT has approvals in auto-immune diseases partly due to that inhibiting JAKs will dampen cytokine effects, however in cancer the biology & rationale seems less clear.
2.  Can we safely target the WNT pathway?, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2014
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd4233
    -   Wnt seems even worse than JAK due to the high complexity and involvement in normal conditions (JAK in normal inflammatory response & wnt in normal development). JAK at least can be targetted for auto-immunity by blocking all JAK outputs despite its complexity, while Wnt seems even worse since
the blocking result seems unknown and risky regarding the development.

#   BCMA
this target offers an example on different modalities trialed on a single target and is very useful.
1.  FDA approves first BCMA-targeted therapeutic, Nrd 2020
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00157-2#:~:text=The%20FDA%20has%20approved%20GlaxoSmithKline%20%28GSK%29%E2%80%99s%20belantamab%20mafodotin,from%20the%20crowded%20BCMA-targeted%20pipeline%20to%20secure%20approval.
    -   BCMA, a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily, is expressed on normal B lymphocytes as well as on multiple myeloma cells. Despite early efforts to target BCMA with canonical monoclonal antibodies, early candidates did not have sufficient efficacy to move forward. In recent years, however, drug developers have had more success with ADCs, bispecific antibodies and CAR-T cell therapies.
2.  the BCMA bonanza, Nrd 2019
    -   https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-019-00105-9
    -   **Great targets are scarce, and so researchers across the biopharmaceutical industry tend to pile in when they come along.** And when the biology is just right, such targets promise not just new therapeutic options and commercial opportunities, but also rare chances to explore emerging drug modalities. BCMA, for the treatment of multiple myeloma, is the latest case in point.
    -   **Interest here is driven in part by the clinical challenges of multiple myeloma**, the second most common haematological malignancy after non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite big advances in recent years with chemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulating thalidomide derivatives and CD38-targeted antibodies, nearly all patients still eventually relapse. 
    -   **The BCMA target is also so clean in its expression profile that it provides an irresistible testing ground for novel modalities.**
    -   **The BCMA gene was identified in 1992, and was found shortly after to be associated with B cell maturation and with multiple myeloma. Further work revealed that BCMA is only expressed on plasma cells, that it is over-expressed on multiple myeloma cells and that it is dispensable for overall B cell health and homeostasis. These characteristics make it a compelling target, with a rock solid disease association and limited risk of off-tissue toxicity.**
    -   **By 2007 researchers across industry had identified monoclonal antibodies and ADCs that bound BCMA and killed cancer cells, but early development work with these stalled. For as yet undetermined reasons, early candidates just didn’t drive sufficiently strong efficacy signals to push the field forward. And at the same time, the multiple myeloma community was so focused on the development of proteasome inhibitors, thalidomide derivatives and CD38 blockers that BCMA fell by the wayside, **
    -   “The next big thing for multiple myeloma that we need to crack is what makes a difference in terms of durability and cure-ability,” adds Garfall. “I would love to see some focused effort on that, rather than just more of the same or similar BCMA CAR-Ts being churned out.”
    -   The expression profile of BCMA is so clean — restricted to plasma cells and overexpressed in myeloma — that it is the perfect candidate for an ADC, adds Hal Barron, CSO at GSK. “**If you can find an overexpressed antigen that is unique to a disease, it is really an ideal target for an ADC**. There may not be as many of these as we had hoped, and ADCs might have been a little overhyped, **but I think there are more cancers where these antigens are overexpressed and can be taken advantage of**.”

    -   https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-030419-033635
    -   Merck's IDO1 inhibitor + PD1 blockade doesn't show benefit over PD1 alone
    -   discourages other IDO1 trials from BMS, Roche, & Pfizer, see:
        -   Tryptophan metabolism as a common therapeutic target in cancer, neurodegeneration and beyond, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2019
        -   https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-019-0016-5
    -   accumulated data prior to the phase-III failure:
        -   known mechanism (IDO1 expressed by tumour cells depletes Tryptophan required by CD8 T cell)
            -   personal comment: think this is the reason, such meachanisms don't sound solid, 
            -   at least less solid than membrane proteins.
        -   'frequently' expressed in tumours
        -   validated in pre-clinical tumour models
        -   distribution on healthy tissue clear 
            -   personal comment: (think this is mostly with toxicity issues, nothing related to the failure)
            -   note the healthy tissue distribution was validated in 2015, before scRNA-seq was widely applied.
        -   phaseI & II bode well
        -   pre-cilinically doesn't work alone but works in combination with otehr immunotherapy targets
        -   first human trial validated the inhibitor alone had tryptophan effect but no patient response observed
        -   skip usual steps between phaseI & III is a mistake, see article, due to patient selection issues

        -   Cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade, Science, 2018
            -   The high- est antitumor activities of single-agent PD-1–blockade therapy are in Hodgkin’s lym- phoma, in which there is con- stitutive expression of PD-L1 through a common amplifica- tion of the PD-L1–encoding locus together with PD-L2 and Janus kinase.

    -   CD30 ADC
        -   Brentuximab vedotin, Nature reviews drug discovery, 2012
            -   CD30, which is a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily, **is highly expressed on the surface of tumour cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma and ALCL2,3,4**. Furthermore, its **normal expression is limited largely to activated immune cells, and CD30 was therefore considered to be a promising target** antigen for mAb-based anticancer therapies2,3,4. However, although human CD30-specific mAbs such as the chimeric mAb cAC10 showed anticancer activity in preclinical studies3, their activity in clinical trials was limited.
            -   Both Hodgkin's lymphoma and ALCL are relatively rare cancers, accounting for ∼11,000 newly diagnosed patients, combined, annually in the United States. Importantly, both Hodgkin's lymphoma and ALCL are potentially highly curable types of lymphoma when conventional chemotherapy regimens and radiation therapy are used. However, around one-third of patients are not cured with currently available front-line regimens and require additional therapy. The standard of care for these patients is a second-line treatment to induce a second remission, which can then be consolidated by stem cell transplantation. Such a 'salvage' approach can cure 50% of patients with relapsed and refractory lymphomas. However, patients who relapse after ASCT are considered incurable, and **represent an unmet medical need**.
            -   Brentuximab vedotin is **the first drug to be approved** for Hodgkin’s lymphoma in three decades, and provides a new therapeutic option for patients with refractory disease.
